# LillyCheck

Welcome to LillyCheck, a comprehensive platform designed to streamline and centralize the onboarding process for new employees at Lilly. Our aim is to provide a seamless integration into the company by facilitating access to necessary tools and information.

## Overview

LillyCheck is an employee dashboard built using modern web technologies, including React and Next.js, as well as Django for the backend and PostgreSQL for the database, as well as an AI assistant. It features a dynamic user interface that helps new hires manage their onboarding tasks efficiently. 

As much as we want to streamline the onboarding process, the pre-boarding process is equally important. We have included a AI Powered Recommendation System that will allow managers to recommend the best onboarding tasks for their new hires. This will help the new hires to get a head start on their onboarding process. 

### Key Features

- **Task Management:** Track onboarding tasks with status updates and average completion times.
- **Access Requests:** Easily request access to essential platforms like GitHub, Cortex, Backstage, JIRA, Slack, and CATS.
- **Progress Tracking:** View and manage your progress through various stages of the onboarding process and get inspiration points to redeem for rewards at Lilly!
- **AI Recommendations:** Receive personalized recommendations for onboarding tasks based on your role and department.
- **AI Assistant:** Interact with an AI assistant to get answers to common questions and receive guidance on the onboarding process.
